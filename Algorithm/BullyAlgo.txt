1. Initialization:
Any process can initiate the election by sending an election message to all processes with higher process IDs than its own.

2. Election Message:
The process that starts the election sends a message to all higher-ID processes, saying, "I want to start an election."

3. Response from Higher-ID Processes:
If any process with a higher ID receives the election message, it responds by sending a message back to the initiator, indicating that it will take over the election.
The initiator waits for responses. If no response is received, the initiator becomes the leader.

4. Coordinator Announcement:
Once the election reaches a process with no higher-ID responses, that process becomes the leader (or coordinator).
This process then broadcasts its election as the leader to all other processes.
Failure Detection:

5. If a process detects that the current leader is not responding, it will initiate the election process by sending messages again, following the above steps.
