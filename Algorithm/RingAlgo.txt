1. Initialization:
The election is initiated by a process that starts the message circulation. 
The initiator sends an election message containing its own ID to the next process in the ring.

2. Message Passing:
Each process receives the message and compares the ID in the message with its own. 
If the process has a higher ID, it replaces the ID in the message with its own and forwards it to the next process in the ring. 
Otherwise, it simply forwards the message.

3. Leader Determination:
Once the message has traveled around the entire ring and returned to the initiator, 
the process that holds the highest ID in the message is declared the leader.

4. Leader Announcement:
The process with the highest ID announces itself as the leader to all other processes in the ring.

5. Failure Handling:
If the leader process fails, any process can initiate a new election following the same steps.
